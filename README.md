# DBIx::OpenTracing
Automatically create OpenTracing spans around DBI queries

## Usage

```perl

use DBI;
use DBIx::OpenTracing;

# use DBI as usual
my $dbh = DBI->connect(...);
$dbh->do(...);

DBIx::OpenTracing->disable();
$dbh->do($secret_query);
DBIx::OpenTracing->enable();

sub process_secrets {
    DBIx::OpenTracing->suspend();
    ...
}

```

## About

This module overrides L<DBI> methods to create spans around all queries.
It will also try to extract information like the query SQL and the number
of rows returned. L<OpenTracing::GlobalTracer> is used to accomplish this,
so make sure you set your tracer there.
